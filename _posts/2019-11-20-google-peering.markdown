[Google Peering FAQ]
- Q. Where can my network peer with Google?
- A. Please see the Google ([AS15169]) entry in PeeringDB for Internet Exchanges we are connected to, along with private peering facilities.
- Q. What is AS36040?
- A. In some locations, part of Google's content is also reachable through [AS36040]. This ASN serves a subset of eligible Google content. Due to the unique nature of AS36040, it does not have the same peering policy.
